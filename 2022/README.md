# 2022
I first found out about Advent of Code last year, but only completed a few of the challenges. This year I would like to complete them all.  

I'm not concerned about the global leaderboard; I'll complete the challenges throughout the day, not at midnight. Instead, I'd like to take the opportunity to expose myself to a variety of programming languages.

Day 01: Python  
Day 02: Dart  
Day 03: Go  
Day 04: Rust  
Day 05: C#  
Day 06: Java  
Day 07: JavaScript  
Day 08: C  
Day 09: Kotlin  
Day 10: Ruby  
Day 11: Lua  
Day 12: C++  
Day 13: Rust  
Day 14: Go  
Day 15: C#  
Day 16: Dart    
Day 17: Rust  
Day 18: Go  
Day 19: C#  
Day 20: Dart  
Day 21: Rust  
Day 22: Go  
Day 23: C#  
Day 24: Dart  
Day 25: Random(12)  

12 languages for the first 12 days.  
Dart and Rust are languages that I'm actively learning at the moment, so a bias towards those for the last 10 days (especially Dart because I have less experience there).  
I will be working with C# in the near future, so I want to build up some proficiency.  
Go and Rust are languages that I'm especially excited about the future of, so I want to focus on both.  
Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and C++ are all languages that I have a good amount of experience in already.  
Kotlin, Ruby, and Lua are going to be completely new to me.
