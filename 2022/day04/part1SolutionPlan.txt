Each pair has `startA-endA,startB-endB`.


(assume startA != startB, endA != endB)
if
`startA - startB`
has the same sign as
`endA - endB`
then
`startA < startB && endA < endB`
or
`startA > startB && endA > endB`
therefore no overlap

however if the signs are different,
`startA < startB && endA > endB`
or
`startA > startB && endA < endB`
therefore overlap

[sign can be compared using X * Y; +ve product: same sign, -ve product: different sign]



if 
`startA == startB`
then (one of)
`endA <  endB` -> B contains A
`endA == endB` -> A and B contain each other?
`endA >  endB` -> A contains B

[check this before the above]
