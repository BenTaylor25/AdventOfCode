Today was meant to be my 12th language in 12 days.  
Unfortunately I have failed in this goal, though I'm happy that I at least completed today's challenge.  
Near the start of AoC, the challenges were fairly easy, so solving them in different languages was doable in reasonable time.
Now I'm spending most of my day solving the problem, and I can't really afford to be doing that right now.  
I'd like to complete one of the 13 remaining challenges in C++, but I'll decide the language for the day once I've seen the question.
