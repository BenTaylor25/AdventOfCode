# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar of yearly programming challenges, created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

I did the first few challenges in 2021, but ran out of time due to uni coursework.  
From 2022 I hope to complete all of the challenges as they are released.  
I may go back and complete previous years' challenges as well.
